\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chapter:conclusion}
From the previous experiments, we can conclude that a BERT-based model was a good choice for the FA model due to the broadly pre-trained training corpus and ease of use. It is also easy to apply and incorporate for the following classification. Since no suitable models exist in the semiconductor domain yet and most of the BERT models were trained with mainly medical and biomedical papers, it was cumbersome to find a suitable model entry point since the medical vocabulary can lead to a degradation of performance on semiconductor texts.
